# inTRACKtive_yt_demo

This repo contains a notebook that describes how to extract particle positions from a timeseries loaded with `yt` and write out a CSV file in the format expected by the inTRACKtive conversion tools: [yt_particles_to_inTRACKtive_csv.ipynb](https://github.com/data-exp-lab/inTRACKtive_yt_demo/blob/main/yt_particles_to_inTRACKtive_csv.ipynb). The notebook also describes how to further process the intermediate CSV and make it available to inTRACKtive using the inTRACKtive repo's [tools](https://github.com/royerlab/inTRACKtive/tree/main/tools).
